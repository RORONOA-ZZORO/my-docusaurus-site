### What This Career Is
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It's about staying one step ahead of the "bad actors."

- **Real-world Examples**: Preventing a bank database from being hacked, or stopping a ransomware attack on a hospital.
- **Day-to-day Work**: Monitoring networks for threats, performing "penetration tests" (ethical hacking), and setting up firewalls.

### 👤 Who This Path Is For
- **Interests**: Security, investigation, ethics, and protecting people.
- **Personality Traits**: Skeptical, detail-oriented, and ethical.
- **Strengths**: "Out-of-the-box" thinking and quick response times.

### 🛠️ Skills You Must Learn
- **Core Technical Skills**: Networking (TCP/IP), Linux Administration, Cryptography.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Wireshark, Metasploit, Kali Linux, Nmap.
- **Soft Skills**: Ethics, report writing, attention to detail.

### 🗺️ Beginner-to-Job Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1: Foundations**: Learn how computers and networks work (A+ and Network+ level).
2.  **Phase 2: Security Basics**: Learn about common vulnerabilities and how to fix them.
3.  **Phase 3: Hands-on**: Use labs like TryHackMe or HackTheBox to practice ethical hacking.
4.  **Phase 4: Specialization**: Choose Blue Team (Defense) or Red Team (Offense) and get certified.
