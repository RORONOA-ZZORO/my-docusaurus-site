# ☁️ Cloud & DevOps: Scaling the Web

<DynamicQuote path="cloud-devops" />

### What This Career Is
Cloud Engineers build and manage the infrastructure where apps live (like AWS or Azure). DevOps is the bridge between developers and IT, making sure software is delivered fast and reliably.

- **Real-world Examples**: Making sure Netflix doesn't crash during a new show launch, or automating the build process for a mobile app.
- **Day-to-day Work**: Writing "Infrastructure as Code," setting up CI/CD pipelines, and monitoring server health.

### 👤 Who This Path Is For
- **Interests**: Infrastructure, automation, reliability, and scaling systems.
- **Personality Traits**: Efficient, organized, and calm under pressure.
- **Strengths**: Optimizing workflows and systems thinking.

### 🛠️ Skills You Must Learn
- **Core Technical Skills**: Linux, Cloud (AWS/Azure/GCP), CI/CD, Scripting (Python/Bash).
- **Tools & Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
- **Soft Skills**: Collaboration, reliability, incident management.

### 🗺️ Beginner-to-Job Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1: Foundations**: Learn Linux and basic networking.
2.  **Phase 2: Cloud Basics**: Get a beginner cloud certification (like AWS Practitioner).
3.  **Phase 3: Automation**: Learn Docker and how to automate deployments with CI/CD.
4.  **Phase 4: Advanced Infrastructure**: Learn Kubernetes and Terraform for managing large-scale systems.
