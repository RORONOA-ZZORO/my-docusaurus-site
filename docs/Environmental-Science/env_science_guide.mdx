# Unit I — Introduction to Environment

## 🔍 Meaning & Definitions

### 📖 Core Concept

Environment refers to the **complete surroundings** of an organism, encompassing all living and non-living elements that influence its existence, growth, development, and survival. The term 'environment' comes from the French word 'environ' meaning 'to surround'.

The environment provides the necessary conditions for life processes and includes everything that affects an organism directly or indirectly. It is not just the physical space around us, but includes complex interactions between various components that create the conditions necessary for life on Earth.

### 🌍 Detailed Description of Natural Environment

**Lithosphere** forms the solid foundation of our planet. It includes continental landmasses and ocean floors, providing habitats for terrestrial organisms and sources of minerals and fossil fuels. The lithosphere is constantly changing through processes like erosion, weathering, and tectonic activity.

**Hydrosphere** covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface. It plays a crucial role in climate regulation, supports aquatic ecosystems, and is essential for all life processes. The water cycle connects all parts of the hydrosphere and redistributes water globally.

**Atmosphere** consists of several layers with different characteristics. The troposphere contains most weather phenomena and breathable air. The stratosphere contains the ozone layer that protects us from harmful UV radiation. The atmosphere regulates Earth's temperature through the greenhouse effect.

**Biosphere** represents the integration of all living systems on Earth. It includes terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial environments where organisms live, interact, and evolve. The biosphere is characterized by incredible diversity and complex interdependencies.

## 🔗 Interrelationships

### 🔄 Understanding Environmental Interconnections

Environmental components do not exist in isolation; they are interconnected through complex relationships that form the basis of ecological systems. These interrelationships demonstrate that changes in one component can have cascading effects throughout the entire system.

**Types of Interrelationships:**

**1. Biotic-Abiotic Interactions**: Living organisms depend on non-living factors for survival, while their activities modify abiotic conditions. For example:
- Plants require sunlight, water, and nutrients from soil (abiotic factors) for photosynthesis
- Plant roots help prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure
- Animals require suitable climate conditions and modify their physical environment through burrowing, nest building, etc.

**2. Biotic-Biotic Interactions**: Living organisms interact with each other in various ways:
- **Competition**: Organisms compete for limited resources like food, water, shelter
- **Predation**: One organism feeds on another, controlling population sizes
- **Symbiosis**: Organisms live together in close association (mutualism, commensalism, parasitism)
- **Food relationships**: Energy and nutrients flow through food chains and webs

**3. Human-Environment Interactions**: Humans both depend on and modify the environment:
- **Dependence**: Humans need clean air, water, food, and natural resources
- **Modification**: Human activities alter landscapes, climate, and ecosystems through agriculture, industry, and urbanization
- **Feedback effects**: Environmental changes affect human health, economy, and society
