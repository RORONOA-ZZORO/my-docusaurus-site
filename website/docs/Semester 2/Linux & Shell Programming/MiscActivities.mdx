Linux and Shell Programming

1. Introduction to Linux

(i) What is Linux?

Linux is a free and open-source operating system used to run computers, servers, mobile devices, and even supercomputers.
It was developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and is based on the UNIX philosophy.


---

(ii) Components of Linux

1. Core of Linux (Kernel) – Manages hardware resources


2. Shell – Interface to communicate with the kernel


3. File System – Organizes data into directories


4. Utilities – Tools like ls, cp, mv, grep




---

(iii) Linux Distributions (Distros)

Linux comes in many versions called distributions, such as:

Ubuntu

Fedora

Debian

Linux Mint

Arch Linux



---

(iv) Applications of Linux

Personal computers and laptops

Web servers (Google, Facebook, Amazon use Linux)

Android phones (Android is Linux-based)

Embedded systems (ATMs, Smart TVs)



---

(v) Linux for Students (like BCA students)

Linux is very useful for:

Learning C, C++, Java, Python

Understanding Operating Systems

Practicing Networking and Cyber Security

Working with servers and cloud


Conclusion:
Linux is a powerful, secure, free, and flexible operating system widely used in education, industry, and technology.

2. Architecture of Linux

The Linux architecture is a layered structure where each layer performs a specific function. These layers work together to allow users to interact with computer hardware efficiently and securely.

Basic Architecture Layers:

User

Shell

Software

Kernel

Hardware (CPU, RAM, Storage, I/O)



---

3. Hardware Layer

The hardware layer is the lowest level in Linux architecture. It includes all physical components of the computer.

Components of Computer:

CPU (Central Processing Unit) – Executes instructions

RAM (Memory) – Stores data and programs temporarily

Hard Disk / SSD – Permanent data storage

Input Devices – Keyboard, mouse, scanner

Output Devices – Monitor, printer


Role of Hardware:

Provides physical resources

Does not interact directly with users

Controlled by the Linux kernel



---

4. Software – Linux Kernel

The kernel is the core (heart) of the Linux operating system. It directly communicates with hardware and manages all system resources.

Functions of Kernel:

Process Management – Controls execution of processes

Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates memory

Device Management – Uses device drivers to control hardware

File System Management – Manages files and directories

System Calls – Interface between user programs and hardware


Features of Linux Kernel:

Monolithic kernel (but modular)

Secure and stable

Controls access to hardware


Without the kernel, Linux cannot function.


---

5. Shell

The shell is a command interpreter that acts as a bridge between the user and the kernel.

What does a shell do?

Takes commands from the user

Interprets them

Passes them to the kernel for execution

Displays output to the user


Types of Shell:

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) – Most common

Zsh

C Shell (csh)

Korn Shell (ksh)


Example:

ls

Command used to list all files.


---

6. User

The user layer is the topmost level of Linux architecture.

Who is a user?

Human users

System administrators

Programmers


User Interaction:

Uses commands, applications, or GUI

Does not interact directly with hardware

Communicates through the shell


User Types:

1. Root User

Full system access

Can install software, change system files, manage users, configure hardware



2. Normal User

Limited permissions

Regular user account





---

7. Features of Linux

1. Open Source

Released under GNU Public License (GPL)

Source code is publicly available

Developers can modify, compile, and redistribute

Community review improves quality and security


2. Multiuser Support

Each user has a User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID)

Every process runs under a specific user

File permissions (read, write, execute) control access

Kernel enforces user isolation


3. Multitasking

Uses preemptive multitasking

CPU time is shared using time slicing

Multiple processes appear to run simultaneously


4. Portability

Mostly written in C language

Hardware-dependent code is separated from core kernel

Can be recompiled for different hardware platforms


5. Security

Strong file permission model (owner, group, others)

Separation between user mode and kernel mode

Security modules like SELinux and AppArmor

Root access is restricted and controlled


6. Stability and Reliability

User applications run in user space, separate from kernel space

Crashing programs do not crash the kernel

Uses journaling file systems

Efficient memory management prevents data corruption
